# Closures

Javascript is a synchronous language
When our thread of execution is going line by line saving variables and function definitions to global memory, we will eventually  (maybe) reach a line that executes a function
When we execute that function Javascript creates an execution context specifically to run that function
Inside of that execution context there's a local memory... that local memory, when its done being used isn't deleted or collected by the garbage collector it is packaged away and carried by the return statement

Closures are like a candy factory
